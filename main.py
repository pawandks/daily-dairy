# --- Friendly AI Trip Planner in Python ---

# 1. Installation
# Before running, you need to install the Google AI Python library.
# Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
# pip install google-generativeai

import google.generativeai as genai
import json
import getpass

# --- 2. Define the Agent's "Tools" (Functions) ---
# These are the Python functions the AI agent can decide to call.
# The docstrings are important, as the AI uses them to understand what each tool does.
